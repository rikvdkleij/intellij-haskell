# IntelliJ plugin for Haskell

When I was learning Haskell, I missed the nice features of IntelliJ IDEA. My first approach
was to use default way of creating an IntelliJ plugin by defining a grammar and a lexer according to
[Haskell report](http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch10.html). That didn't work out because I could not define all 
the recursion. 
Then I decided to use grammar and lexer definitions only for tokenizing and parsing Haskell code, and not for syntax checking the code. This is needed for syntax highlighting, all kinds of navigation and so on.
Further Haskell language support is provided with the support of external tools: ghc-mod and haskell-docs.

This plugin is written mainly in Scala and is not meant to support GHC/Cabal directly. It supports sandbox projects
and expects that Cabal init/install/build is done on the command line.

Any feedback is welcome!!


# Features

![Screenshot](./img/screenshot-quicksort.png)

- Syntax highlighting (which can be customized);
- Error/warning highlighting;
- Find usages of identifiers;
- Resolve references to identifiers (also to library code if library source code is added to project and resolves inside import declaration);
- Code completion by resolving references;
- In-place rename identifiers (in which global rename first shows preview so refactoring scope can be adjusted).
- View type info from (selected) expression;
- View expression info;
- View quick documentation;
- View quick definition;
- Structure view;
- Navigate to declaration (called `Class` in IntelliJ menu);
- Navigate to identifier (called `Symbol` in IntelliJ menu);
- Code completion by looking to import declarations;
- Simple form of code formatting;
- Inspection by HLint;
- Quick fixes for HLint suggestions;
- View error, action to view formatted message from ghc-mod. Especially useful in case message consists of multiple lines (Ctrl-F10, Meta-F10 on Mac OSX);
- Intention actions (suggested by ghc-mod);
            
A lot of features are with the help of ghc-mod(i)!!


# Getting started: 
- Cabal install latest versions of ghc-mod and haskell-docs;
- Set file paths to `ghc-mod`, `ghc-modi`, `hlint` and `haskell-docs` in the menu `Other Settings/Haskell`.
- Be sure in `Editor/Filetypes` that `Haskell language file` is registered with pattern `*.hs` and `Literate Haskell language file` with pattern `*.lhs`; 
- First install and build your project in a Cabal sandbox. (Make sure that Haddock documentation is generated, see [haskell-docs](https://github.com/chrisdone/haskell-docs)). 
- After the project is built in the sandbox, create a Haskell project in IntelliJ by using `File`/`New`/`Project...` from the IntelliJ menu;
- In the `New Project` wizard create `GHC SDK` by selecting path to GHC binaries, e.g. `/usr/local/bin`;
- Finish wizard;
- Add `Content Root` to Haskell module in `Project Settings`/`Modules`/`Sources` by selecting root folder of Haskell sandbox project;
- Select in `Project settings`/`Modules` which folders to exclude (like `.cabal-sandbox` and `dist`) and which folders are `Source` and `Test` (normally `src` and `test`).
- To get nice navigation features: add for libraries and Prelude (base, ghc-prim and integer-gmp packages) the source root directories to project in `Project Settings`/`Libraries`. `cabal get` is useful for getting source code of package.
    To get source code of libraries in `Project view`, create for example a directory `lib` inside project root directory and put source roots there;
- When you get an error like `NG BUG: GMECabalCompAssignment [(Left "lib/directory-1.2.1.0/System/Directory.hs",fromList [])]`, add the source root (in this example `lib/directory-1.2.1.0`) to `Project Settings`/`Libraries` because
    ghc-mod(i) does not support Haskell files which are not part of project itself;
- Be sure all module names are directly or indirectly listed in Cabal file;

# Remarks
- ghc-mod does not support GHC < 7.10 and Cabal 1.22. See for more info the [ghc-mod wiki](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/ghc-mod/wiki). So in
    case you are using for example GHC 7.8.4, you will have to use Cabal 1.20.x;
- In Navigation dialog dots can not be used. Workaround is by using spaces instead of dots, so when you want to go to `Control.Lens`, type `Control Lens`;
- IntelliJ has a nice terminal plugin, useful for executing the Cabal commands;
- ghc-mod can not help in library files and if Haskell source file contains not completely valid Haskell (e.g. while typing). In that case I try to solve request by using AST-tree (IntelliJ calls it PSI-tree). 
- Because of ghc-mod issue #275 ghc-mod is used (instead of ghc-modi) for checking syntax of Haskell file;
- Because of ghc-mod issue #362 ghc-mod is used (instead of ghc-modi) for getting symbols of module using `browse` command. Performance for code completion will probably improve if I can use ghc-modi for `browse`;
- It would be nice if ghc-mod issue #303 would be solved. That would made it possible to get support from ghc-mod while type/syntax errors exist. For example, while typing.
- <del> Created workaround for this issue: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-130894. </del>
- Developed plugin on Ubuntu;
- During testing on Mac OSX Yosemite Beta I noticed problem with ghc-modi: PATH environment variable asked from within IntelliJ was not the same as the global one. I had to create workaround only for Mac OSX :-( 
    This workaround will add path of `GHC SDK` to PATH environment variable which is passed to ghc-modi process. Other solutions are welcome!
- Windows is not supported. Maybe it will work okay but I can not test it;
- Created workaround for ghc-mod issue #432;
- <del> I found an issue in IntelliJ 14.1, see https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-138236. Hopefully they will fix it soon; </del>

# How to build
1. Clone this project;
1. Clone IntelliJ Communitiy Edition (optional, it's needed to navigate to IntelliJ source code). Check out right tag by looking to version number;
1. Install/enable plugins: Plugin Devkit, Grammar-Kit and PsiViewer;
1. Open this project and check/change paths of `IntelliJ Platform Plugin SDK`. Also check/change path to it's sources (use root directory from step 2);
1. Check/change paths to Scala dependencies: scala-sdk, scalatest and spray-json;
1. Navigate to `_HaskellLexer.flex` and run `Run Flex Generator`. This will generate `_HaskellLexer.java`;
1. Navigate to `haskell.bnf` and run `Generate Parser Code`. This will generate parser Java files in `gen` directory;
1. Select `Make project` from `Build` menu;
1. To run/debug this plugin select `intellij-haskell` in `Configurations`;
